# React Core Meeting Notes

React Core team meets once a week to discuss the development of React, future plans, and priorities.  
These notes are relatively new and started in March, 2016. You can find an archive of older notes [here](https://discuss.reactjs.org/c/meeting-notes).

The repo format is inspired by [Ember Core Notes](https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes).
